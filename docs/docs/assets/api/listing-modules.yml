Possible states include: <code>available</code>, <code>queued</code> or <code>failed</code>. A version that is in the <code>available</code> state is ready to be used by a webtask. A version that is in the <code>queued</code> state is currently being processed and will be available soon. Before taking a dependency on a <code>queued</code> version, poll until the state transitions to the <code>available</code> state. For a version that is in the <code>failed</code> state, please contact support."
