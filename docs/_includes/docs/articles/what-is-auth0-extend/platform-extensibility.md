## Platform Extensibility  

One of the most important features you will add to your SaaS product is extensibility. Extensibility allows your customers to customize and integrate your platform with the ecosystem around it, creating synergy, accelerating growth, and increasing customer loyalty. You don't have to look far to see how this strategy pays off: virtually all successful SaaS platforms thrive on extensibility: from Slack, SalesForce, to GitHub and Zendesk.  

The most popular mechanism used by SaaS products today to offer extensibility is based on web hooks. Web hooks enable the customer to create a web service that will be called when a certain event occurs in your platform. Web hooks are very powerful and flexible: they allow customers to implement arbitrary business logic to extend your core product. 

Yet web hooks have their disadvantages. Using webhooks requires your customers to invest in and address several layers of concerns related to running a web service: hosting, monitoring, securing, ensuring availability, and more. All this increases the barrier to extending your product and your customers' time to market.
