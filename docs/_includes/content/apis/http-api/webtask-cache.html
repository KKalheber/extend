  Webtask runtime maintains in-memory cache of some webtask atrifacts that are normally durably persisted. This allows the runtime to reduce the latency of execution for frequently running webtasks. A good example of data that is cached is the compiled form of the webtask code itself. First execution of a given webtask requires the code to be fetched from the durable storage, but once that code is compiled into a JavaScript function, the function is cached in memory to speed up future invocations.

  Webtask runtime takes care of purging the caches in certain situations to provide good developer experience. For example, when you update the code of a webtask, the previously compiled, cached versions of it are purged from the system. However, you can also explicitly request webtask cache to be purged using the HTTP APIs below.
