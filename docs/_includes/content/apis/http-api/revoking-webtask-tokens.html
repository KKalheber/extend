  A webtask token can be revoked in order to prevent its future use to execute webtasks. When a webtask token is revoked, all webtask tokens directly or indirectly issued using it are also revoked. Revocation cannot be undone.

  <strong>NOTE:</strong> revoked tokens may still be accepted for a short time after revocation (by default 2 minutes) due to caching of revocation status in the webtask runtime.
