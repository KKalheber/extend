  Sometimes your code needs just a little bit of persistent storage, and using a full database feels like too much. Webtask code can durably store a single JSON document up to 500KB in size using built-in storage. With simple get/set APIs and basic conflict detection, this is frequently all you need.

  Storage APIs are only available from within named webtasks. They are not available from code submitted for execution as part of the HTTP POST request body.
