  The streaming logs endpoint allows you real time access to output generated to stdout and stderr by executing webtask code. This includes output of Node.js's console.log calls. Streaming logs are a useful development time tool. Logs generated by several webtask requests executing within the same webtask container are consolidated into a single stream.
