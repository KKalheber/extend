## Enabling External Logging

Your Auth0 Extend installation can be configured to export logging information to your own [AWS Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/firehose/) service. This provides you with the capability to store and analyze logs generated by your users' extensions in Amazon S3, Amazon ElasticSearch, Amazon Kinesis Analytics, or Amazon Redshift. The logging information contains all output generated by your user's extension code to standard output, as well as selected infrastructure events generated by Auth0 Extend itself. Contact [support](#support) if you are interested in configuring this capability in your installation. 

Auth0 Extend uses [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) to format the logs exported to AWS Firehose. Logs are a stream of individual JSON objects separated with a newline. 

The fields contained in every JSON record vary, but some of the most important ones include: 

* **time**: server time of the event. 

* **level**: log level: 30 - info, 40 - warning, 50 - error. 

* **msg**: description of the event. 

* **req_id**, **deployment_key**: A unique request ID of the execution request within your Auth0 Extend installation. If you are contacting support with an issue to investigate, this information will help zero-in on the transaction in question.
