## Platform Extensibility  

Auth0 Extend is the ideal solution for SaaS providers who want to provide their customers with the best possible experience when it comes to extending their product.

If you are a SaaS provider, extensibility allows your customers to customize and integrate your platform with the ecosystem around it, creating synergy, accelerating growth, and increasing customer loyalty. You don't have to look far to see how this strategy pays off.  Virtually all successful SaaS platforms thrive on extensibility, from Slack and SalesForce to GitHub and Zendesk.

Most SaaS products today rely on webhooks for extensibility. With webhooks, a customer hosts their own web service that will be called when a certain event occurs in your SaaS platform. Webhooks are very powerful and flexible: they allow customers to implement arbitrary business logic to extend your core product.

Yet web hooks have their disadvantages. Webhooks requires your customers to invest in running a web service and that includes handling a host of concerns: hosting, monitoring, security, availability, and more. All this increases friction and makes extensibility less attractive for your customers. Auth0 Extend helps you add extensibility to your SaaS product in a way that addresses these concerns.

Auth0 Extend is a managed service that supports secure, "serverless" execution of your customers' extensions, thereby removing all your customers' concerns related to hosting and maintaining a service. Auth0 Extend also provides a rich development environment you can embbed directly into your SaaS platform, allowing your customers to author and debug their extension code without ever leaving your application.
