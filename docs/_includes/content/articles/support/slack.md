## Slack

Our primary community support for Auth0 Extend uses the https://auth0-extend.slack.com Slack team. It is free to join and you can invite yourself [using the sign-up form](https://auth0-extend.run.webtask.io/slack-signup). 

There is usually a team member lurking on the Slack channel and it is the most effective way to engage and ask questions. Having said that, Slack support is based on best effort and we don't offer any SLA. 

Speaking of Slack, did you know Auth0 Extend allows you to extend Slack itself with Node.js? Install our popular and free [Slash Webtasks](https://webtask.io/slack) app on your own Slack team, or join our team above and experience Slash Webtasks by running `/wt` slash command.
