# Extend Editor

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

The Extend Editor can be integrated into your product to provide your users with a first-class, web-based development experience for extensions. There are two ways to expose the Extend Editor to your users: you can host it as part of your own web site, or you can link to it and open it up as a stand-alone web application.

In either mode of integration, Extend Editor supports a range of configuration options to allow you to tailor it's behavior.
