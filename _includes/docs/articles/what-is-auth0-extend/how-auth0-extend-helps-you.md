## How Auth0 Extend Helps You  

Auth0 Extend is a managed service that can be integrated into your SaaS product to support authoring and execution of custom code your customers write to extend your platform. The service supports a rich development environment your customers can use to develop and debug Node.js code that you can embed directly in your platform. The service supports secure, "serverless" execution of these extensions on behalf of your customers, therefore removing all the concerns related to hosting and maintaining a service.
